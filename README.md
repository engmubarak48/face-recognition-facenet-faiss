# face-recognition-facenet-faiss

This reposity is mostly based on facenet to extract embeddings and faiss to search for matched image. I thank to contributers/outhors for providing the models. this repo would be beneficial for those who have more 1m+ images. Instead of using 1-to-1 search, which is very expensive for big databases, here we utilize faiss (A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors) to do 1-to-many search. Having a query image/embedding/ID, we can get the matched image in a few milliseconds (very fast). In this repo, I also store the embedding, Bounding boxes and image paths to microsoft SQL database, incase some of you want.
